# Roomba

> A simulation of an automatic vacuum cleaner.

## Functionality

**Room Builder**

`RoomBuilder` class creates a room based in specific input

`x` - The width of the room  
`y` - The breadth of the room  
`o` - The number of obstructions. These are placed randomly in the room.  

`build_room(5, 5, 2)` should get an output similar to;

| Output | Legend |
| :---: | :---: |
|`xxxxxxx`<br/>`x*****x`<br/>`x*OO**x`<br/>`x*****x`<br/>`xxxxxxx` | x = wall<br/>* = dust<br/>O = Obstruction |  

When the roomba simulation runs, the asterisk (*) character will be replaced with a blank ( ) character to emulated that spot has been cleaned.

**TODO** Need to figure out how to impliment starting position
