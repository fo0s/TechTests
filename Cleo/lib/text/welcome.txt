You are a good looking** software engineer
who is tasked at looking at new applicant's
tech test code when it starts... 
the pre lunch stomach grumbles.

If only you had something to snack on.

"Ooooh!"" you think, "They've installed a new
vending machine in the office."

**Might not be accurate

What would you like to do?

1 <-- Let's go get some snacks mah belly!
2 <-- Meh! Ignore the hunger and keep working.
