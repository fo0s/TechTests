"Let's go get some snacks mah belly!" you exclaim,
(quietly in your head of course. No-one likes a weirdo.)

You proceed to lock your computer (safety first) and
head on over to the vending machine.

You dig around in your pockets and find 3 Â£2 coins.

What would you like to do?

1 <-- Deposit coins into vending machine
2 <-- Check out what's on offer
3 <-- Decide against it. Let's go get a salad instead
