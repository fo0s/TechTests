## What is it?

We were tasked with making a vending machine capable of storing
products with a value. User is able to insert funds to get the
products and change in forms of 'coins' are returned.

It had to be self reloading and had to keep track of the
products and funds.

**Please refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/fo0s/TechTests/wiki) for more detailed documentation.**

### Using the program

Clone this repo  
> `git clone https://github.com/fo0s/TechTests.git`

Change directory into new repo  
> `cd Cleo`

Install dependencies  
> `bundle install`

Check everything is running as should  
> `rspec`

Right now it has to be used in IRB but an
interactive front end is in the works.
